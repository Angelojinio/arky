# Valentine Invite — Simple 3-page project

🎯 What this is

A small 3-page HTML/CSS/JS project that asks "Will you be my Valentine?" and reacts to the user's clicks.

Pages
- `index.html` — Intro paragraph + Continue button
- `will-you.html` — "Will you be my Valentine?" with **Yes** and **No** buttons. Clicking **No** makes the **Yes** button grow; clicking **Yes** goes to the final page.
- `message.html` — A thank-you message and the image.

📁 Files you can edit
- `images/photo.svg` — an SVG heart (editable in any text or vector editor). Replace it with your picture or change `src` in the HTML to use a PNG/JPG.
- `css/styles.css` — visual styles
- `js/script.js` — behavior for the buttons

🚀 How to run
1. Open the folder in your browser or in VS Code and open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click Continue → try the No button a few times → click Yes.

💡 Tips
- To change the picture, replace `images/photo.svg` or point the `<img>` src to another file (e.g., `images/my-photo.jpg`).
- Tweak the growth speed or cap in `js/script.js` (the scale multiplier and the `Math.min` cap).

Enjoy! ❤️
